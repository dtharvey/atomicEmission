Title: Simulation of Atomic Emission Spectra
Version: 1.0.1
Author: David Harvey
Maintainer: David Harvey <harvey@depauw.edu>
Description: Simulates an element's atomic emission spectrum at a 
  given temperature using one of three possible models for 
  estimating the element's temperature-dependent partition function.
  Emission spectra are displayed as either peaks or as lines, 
  and the corresponding atomic absorption line spectrum may be 
  viewed.
